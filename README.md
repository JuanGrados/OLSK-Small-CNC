Introduction
--

The OLSK Small CNC V1 is a desktop CNC milling machine with innovative, compact and sturdy design. The bed, with a milling volume of 600 x 400 x 170 mm (X x Y x Z), features a powerful vacuum system to hold plates without clamping. It is also adapted to fit different international unit systems to allow the fixation of different vices and other accessories. The Z-axis is compact, with a minimum distance to the X-axis linear guides, giving the milling more stability and sturdiness. The linear guides from the Y and Z axis are protected against material chips. The machine also includes a Z height tool sensor and homing with inductive sensors.

Learning by Making
--

The OLSK Small CNC V1 can be offered as an assembly kit with all the necessary parts to build it, saving the user the time to produce and procure the parts. Building a machine provided the opportunity to understand how the machine operates from the inside and the function of each part. This machine can also be built with the help of a workshop lead by the InMachines team, as unique learning experience for small groups, resulting in a full operational CNC milling machine for your makerspace.

The Assembly Workbook
--

All OLSK machines are open source and have the BOM and necessary files available in this repository for replication. The assembly of parts is also documented in a workbook where each step contains a list of parts, tools and instruction remarks, following a logic order to provide a smooth assembly.
